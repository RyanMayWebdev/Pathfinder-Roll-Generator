# DnD-Pathfinder-Roll-Generator
A roll generator for DnD and Pathfinder.
Very basic functionality as of now. The main purpose of this so far is to experiment with JS.

Damage rolls will be added soon.

How to Use:
Enter in your attributes and then your skills. Skills can be left blank and will default to 0 + whatever attribute is associated with them. All skills and attribute fields default to 0. 
If you don't plan to use a skill/don't have that skill then just leave it blank.

Press the submit button to submit character stats which will then be reloaded each time you visit the site.
If you wish to change the submitted stats, press the "Edit Character" button.
If you wish to reset your submitted stats, press the "Reset Character" button.

To generate a roll, select what you are rolling for from the drop down list, then enter what the required roll for success is. (I realize the DM usually keeps this to themselves, so I might change it)
Enter in the amount of dice and their type to roll. ex. 1d20, 2d6, 10d8 etc

Press roll and get your outcome. Best of Luck!
