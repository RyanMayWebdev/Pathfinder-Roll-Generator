# DnD-Pathfinder-Roll-Generator
A roll generator for DnD and Pathfinder.
The main purpose of this so far is to experiment with JS.

How to Use:
Enter in your attributes, caster level, savings throws etc. and then your skills. Skills can be left blank and will default to 0 + whatever attribute is associated with them. All skills and attribute fields default to 0. 
If you don't plan to use a skill/don't have that skill then just leave it blank, same goes for caster level or armouir penalty etc.

Press the submit button to submit character stats which will then be reloaded each time you visit the site.
If you wish to change the submitted stats, press the "Edit Character" button.
If you wish to reset your submitted stats, press the "Reset Character" button.
You can proceed straight to rolling and skip submitting stats if you wish.

To generate a roll, select what you are rolling for from the drop down list.
Enter in the amount of dice and their type to roll. ex. 1d20, 2d6, 10d8 etc You can combine dice as well, ex. 1d6+2d8+5d4 etc.

Press roll and get your outcome. Best of Luck!
